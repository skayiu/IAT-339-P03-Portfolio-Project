          <p> I am currently a third-year student in SFU’s Interactive Arts & Technology (SIAT) program concentrating in design. Throughout the years of pursuing my degree, I have explored different fields within art like, graphic design, photography/film, game design, product design, etc. As art is a broad term to those who are unfamiliar, being able to explore these various fields of art allows me to gain a general knowledge and apply these knowledge when making design considerations on projects. Pursuing in the design concentration of my program, my interests lies within product design and UX/UI design. (95 words) </p>

          <h2> Projects </h2>

          <h4> Cube in a Box (Study Carrel) - IAT 233 Spatial Design </h4>
          <p> Cube in a Box is a team based project for creating a spatial space that serves the purpose of giving an individual their own personal space for studying. Prior to being assigned the project, lecture topics covered form creation and utilizing additive, subtractive or dimensional transformation techniques to give a basic shape a more unique form. As a team, we brainstormed several different shapes to work with like something circular or hexagon. However, in the end, we finalized on my design, which is a geometric heart shape that was inspired by an origami heart. As per the requirements, our team used subtractive transformation on the top to make space for windows and to allow light to shine through the study carrel. On another hand, additive transformation was put on both sides of the heart to give the geometric heart shape a more 3-dimensional design. Similarly, the chair that accompanies the study carrel design is also inspired by origami and additive transformation was put on the back of the chair to give the chair more form. Throughout the process of designing this study carrel, a major component that our team must consider is human dimensions and how the function of the study carrel plays a role in human interactivity. In other words, our team had to consider whether or not the study carrel actually gives enough space for an individual to move around, how much light source will be able to shine through the study carrel if no electricity is provided, how much workspace the individual has and if the individual can sit comfortably in its provided chair. From this project, I’ve learned that not only does a product with an attractive form be pleasing to the human eye, considering human dimensions plays a big role when designing a product, as the users are the ones who will be using the final product. If a pretty design is not functional enough, then the product will not serve its purpose. (328 words) </p>

          <h4> Multimedia App - IAT 265 Multimedia Programming </h4>
          <p> Plushie Showering Day is a multimedia application that is created as the final project for IAT 265. Using the topics covered throughout the course, the final project is an interactive multimedia simulation that demonstrates a process in an environment with a heavy emphasis on user interactivity and dynamic environmental variations, which would allow the user to achieve a designated goal. As the project theme is an open-ended iteration, I based my project theme on the process of washing/giving my plushie a shower. The simulation starts off with the simulation objective given in the form of a task sheet. The task sheet then directs the user to the avatar that is located on the top left corner once the simulation has started, who takes on the role of the user’s “inner self” and will guide the user throughout the simulation. Once the simulation is started, the user can bring the plushie to the shower, rinse him, apply soap on him and then give him a final rinse. By completing these tasks, the objective of giving the plushie a shower will be completed. One of the challenges faced when designing the application was implementing project requirements into the application design I have in mind. For example, involving at least one feature of Perlin noise and at least one feature of fractals done by recursive functions. As this was an open-ended project, I must consider how I can implement this type of code while keeping the outcome consistent with my design without making it seem like I force a design component into my application just to satisfy the project requirements. Additionally, implementing possible ECOs was also a challenge for me as not only does it require creativity, it also poses an issue if I am not able to code it using my own code. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the outcome of my application as it runs smoothly without any bugs and it satisfies all the project requirements along with the additional ECO points.
