    <h1> Hello, my name is Semi! </h1>
    <p> I am currently a third-year student in SFUâ€™s Interactive Arts & Technology (SIAT) program concentrating in design. Throughout the years of pursuing my degree, I have explored different fields within art like, graphic design, photography/film, game design, product design, etc. As art is a broad term to those who are unfamiliar, being able to explore these various fields of art allows me to gain a general knowledge and apply these knowledge when making design considerations on projects. Pursuing in the design concentration of my program, my interests lies within product design and UX/UI design. </p>
