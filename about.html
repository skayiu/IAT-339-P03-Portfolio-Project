      <h2> Hello, my name is Semi! </h2>
    </div>

    <p> Throughout the years of pursuing my degree, I have explored different fields within art like graphic design, photography/film, game design, product design and more. As art is a broad term to those who are unfamiliar, being able to explore these various fields of art allows me to gain a general knowledge and apply these knowledge when making design considerations on projects. However, pursuing in the design concentration of my program, my interests lies within product design and UX/UI design. Some softwares that I have worked with inlcude Photoshop, InDesign, OnShape and Rhino. I have also worked with coding languages like Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript. </p>
