      <h2> Cube in a Box (Study Carrel) </h2>
      <h4> IAT 233 Spatial Design - Spring 2022 </h4>
    </div>

    <h3> Project Overview </h3>
    <p> Cube in a Box is a team based project for creating a spatial space that serves the purpose of giving an individual their own personal space for studying. Prior to being assigned the project, lecture topics covered form creation and utilizing additive, subtractive or dimensional transformation techniques to give a basic shape a more unique form. </p>

    <h4> Softwares Used: </h4>
    <ul> 
      <li> Procreate </li>
      <li> OnShape </li>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <h3> Design Process </h3>
    <p> As a team, we brainstormed several different shapes to work with like something circular or hexagon. However, in the end, we finalized on my design, which is a geometric heart shape that was inspired by an origami heart. As per the requirements, our team used subtractive transformation on the top to make space for windows and to allow light to shine through the study carrel. On another hand, additive transformation was put on both sides of the heart to give the geometric heart shape a more 3-dimensional design. Similarly, the chair that accompanies the study carrel design is also inspired by origami and additive transformation was put on the back of the chair to give the chair more form. </p>

    <h3> Challenges & Considerations </h3>
    Throughout the process of designing this study carrel, a major component that our team must consider is human dimensions and how the function of the study carrel plays a role in human interactivity. In other words, our team had to consider whether or not the study carrel actually gives enough space for an individual to move around, how much light source will be able to shine through the study carrel if no electricity is provided, how much workspace the individual has and if the individual can sit comfortably in its provided chair. </p>

    <h3> Reflection </h3> 
    <p> From this project, Iâ€™ve learned that not only does a product with an attractive form be pleasing to the human eye, considering human dimensions plays a big role when designing a product, as the users are the ones who will be using the final product. If a pretty design is not functional enough, then the product will not serve its purpose. </p>
