      <h2> Plushie Showering Day (Multimedia App) </h2>
      <h4> IAT 265 Multimedia Programming - Fall 2022 </h4>
    </div>

    <h3> Project Overview </h3>
    <p> Plushie Showering Day is a multimedia application that is created as the final project for IAT 265. Using the topics covered throughout the course, the final project is an interactive multimedia simulation that demonstrates a process in an environment with a heavy emphasis on user interactivity and dynamic environmental variations, which would allow the user to achieve a designated goal. As the project theme is an open-ended iteration, I based my project theme on the process of washing/giving my plushie a shower. The simulation starts off with the simulation objective given in the form of a task sheet. The task sheet then directs the user to the avatar that is located on the top left corner once the simulation has started, who takes on the role of the user’s “inner self” and will guide the user throughout the simulation. Once the simulation is started, the user can bring the plushie to the shower, rinse him, apply soap on him and then give him a final rinse. By completing these tasks, the objective of giving the plushie a shower will be completed. One of the challenges faced when designing the application was implementing project requirements into the application design I have in mind. For example, involving at least one feature of Perlin noise and at least one feature of fractals done by recursive functions. As this was an open-ended project, I must consider how I can implement this type of code while keeping the outcome consistent with my design without making it seem like I force a design component into my application just to satisfy the project requirements. Additionally, implementing possible ECOs was also a challenge for me as not only does it require creativity, it also poses an issue if I am not able to code it using my own code. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the outcome of my application as it runs smoothly without any bugs and it satisfies all the project requirements along with the additional ECO points. </p>
